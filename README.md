## Overview
Designing the cleaning service website was a step-by-step affair, beginning with a proposal articulating the need for a professional website to advertise services, become credible, and acquire customers. In the planning stage, the focus was on developing a clean and professional look with HTML as the structure and CSS as the style to make it a clean and modern look that responds. The website had primary pages that included a homepage, services, about, contact, and blog, all with specific functions of showcasing offerings, providing company background, facilitating communication, and providing cleaning tips to establish expertise. The website used neutral colors, rounded corners, and minimalistic elements to convey professionalism and trust. Issues such as inconsistent filenames and problems with homepages loading were solved during implementation through standardized filenames and navigation links. The final result is a working, nice-looking site that conveys the business's identity, highlights its services, and involves clients through content accessibility and interactivity.
